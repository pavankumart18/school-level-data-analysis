This initiative aims to provide high-quality education that is culturally relevant and aligned with national standards while benefiting from the school’s established expertise, facilities, and teaching practices. The new provision will complement existing offerings and broaden access to quality education for families in the area.; Offering more subject options (3) in IGCSE/AS/A2. We have done a student survey and will be looking at adding Media Studies, Politics and Global Perspectives. We will also group more groups in Business, Travel and Tourism, Seperate Sciences and History to allow more students to choose these.; As part of market research, we need to understand how many families within our target demographic—those who can afford our school fees—have children with special educational needs (SEN). This information will help determine whether it is viable to offer a tailored fee structure for these students, as they typically require 1:1 support. A key consideration will be staffing, as the school currently has only one qualified SEN teacher, which may limit the number of students we can support and influence any decisions about additional resourcing or adjustments to the staffing model.; Marketing will play a key role in supporting student recruitment and retention, with a particular focus on promoting the strengths of the new school, including its facilities, staffing, and overall learning environment. The MAC team will make strategic use of existing data to analyse competitor provision and identify areas where the school can offer a clearly differentiated and superior experience. This will enable the school to position its offer confidently within the local market and communicate its unique strengths more effectively to prospective families.

A central focus of the marketing strategy will remain the school’s British School Overseas (BSO) status, as the only BSO-accredited school in the country. This distinction provides a significant competitive advantage and will be used consistently as a key message across all marketing platforms. The forthcoming BSO inspection report, in which the school was judged to be outstanding against almost all standards, will further strengthen this narrative and provide strong external validation of the quality of education, leadership, and pastoral care on offer.

By aligning market analysis with a clear articulation of the school’s unique strengths, the marketing strategy will support sustained growth, enhance the school’s reputation, and reinforce its position as the leading choice for British international education in the region.",2026-08-02 00:00:00,New,0.0,0.038461538,0.038461538,0.080745342,-0.116147309,0.101601656,0.121867509,57.05376344,-0.068005477,1.00125,1.0125,4.01,0.1667,0.1615,5.08,10.0,19.0,0.0,2.0,25.0,15.0,6.0,28.0,0.0,3.0,13.0,34.0,85.0,2.0,17.0,22.0,17.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,30.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,14.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,4.0

The fastest pathway to recovery is to rebuild Primary top-of-funnel by adapting winning tactics for FS1 (+11.2%), Year 11 (+34.2%), and Year 13 (+5.6%) for Early Years, leverage nurtured relationship and activity with Nursery Outreach Program, and host themed Open Day events and parent workshops (open to both current and prospective parents).

Improve enquiry generation by 6% YOY from January 2026 - Mid-February 2026 (6 weeks)

Achieve 24-hour first response contact with all new enquiries within 24 hours; Reasons to Target: YOY new enrollment is down 12.6% overall, but FS1 (+30.2%), Year 5 (+6.3%), Year 8 (+5.6%), and Year 9 (+18.2%) are outperforming. These are natural entry/transition years in the British pathway. So, let's double-down on what's already working in these year groups and duplicate to adjacent entry years.

Cut overall YOY new enrollment decline by 7%

Boost application-to-enrollment conversion by 5% in at least three (3) of the declining year groups

Reduce average decision velocity (application-to-enrollment) to less than 10 days in the declining year groups through time-bound offers

Achieve 24-hour first response contact with all new enquiries within 24 hours; Reasons to Target: Secondary conversion from application to enrollment is the lowest and velocity is the longest, creating significant loss in potential revenue where our fees and brand impact should be the highest.

Increase application-to-enrollment conversion

Keep new enrollments engaged until first day of school

Achieve 24-hour first response contact with all new enquiries within 24 hours; Reasons to Target: Re-enroll eligible (non-graduating) students and lock progression at natural transition years (FS2-to-Y1; Y6-to-Y7; Y11-to-Y12) with tight response times, proactive parent couseling, and time-bound re-enrollment offers.

Re-enrollment variance is down 4.36% YOY and our 3-year average retention is 82%. Thus, there is a need to prevent avoidable churn among non-graduating cohorts as well as provide and communicate more value at transition points where families naturally reassess competitor schools.

Reduce re-enrollment variance to 0 (flat)

Lift overall retention from 82% to 87% for eligible, non-graduating cohorts

Achieve 85% progression commitments in FS2-to-Y1, Y6-to-Y7, and Y11-to-Y12

Reduce average time to re-enroll (offer-to-intention-to-deposit)

the school will maintain monthly tracking of background checks in HireRight and ensure that refresher training is delivered every term. This systematic approach strengthens accountability, reinforces safeguarding culture across the school, and ensures no lapse in required clearances. Additionally, highlighting this achievement in the 2026 Safeguarding Audit will showcase SGS as a model of best practice within the region and reinforce the school’s commitment to student safety and rigorous compliance.; Communicate “value for money” through comparisons, academic results, facilities, and global opportunities; Produce videos, webinars, infographics highlighting IB benefits, NAE membership, and learning environments across all sections; Implement automated email/SMS sequences for each funnel stage (Enquiry → Visit → Application → Enrollment); Allocate more team time, follow-up priority, and personalized support to EY leads; Launch targeted campaigns focused on EY curriculum, student journey, and learning spaces; include parent testimonials and EY success stories; Implement a refundable or creditable fee to reserve a spot after acceptance; communicate benefits clearly during the admissions journey; Build new classrooms for Fine & Performing Arts and thus free classroom space for additional FTE groups, as well as new cafeteria/dining space.

planning process that reviews staffing levels, workload distribution, student enrollment trends, and contractual obligations to ensure alignment with operational capacity and strategic priorities.; To achieve this target, the school will implement a multi-layered retention strategy that addresses both the root causes of attrition and the overall employee experience. This plan focuses on conducting a detailed analysis of why teachers leave, strengthening early recruitment and onboarding to ensure better job fit, and improving compensation competitiveness through benchmarking and structured salary progression. Additionally, the school will prioritize professional development pathways—especially for Teaching Assistants transitioning to teaching roles—while promoting a culture of recognition, support, and well-being. Leadership capacity will be reinforced through training in coaching, communication, and teacher support, ensuring that managers contribute positively to retention. By aligning workload, career growth, and organizational culture with teacher expectations and needs, the school aims to significantly reduce attrition and build a more stable, engaged, and high-performing faculty.; To reach this target, the school 
will establish a structured compliance process for all third-party vendors, requiring that every external worker complete safeguarding training and background checks prior to receiving campus access. This plan includes updating vendor contracts to include mandatory compliance clauses, implementing access control rules (no badge without clearance), and coordinating monthly compliance reviews with each vendor company. SGS will provide scheduled training sessions and clear deadlines to support completion, while holding vendors accountable through written reminders, compliance checkpoints, and escalation procedures when requirements are not met. By aligning vendor expectations with SGS’s safeguarding culture and monitoring progress consistently, the school will ensure that all adults on campus meet the same high standards of student safety.; Partner with relocation influencers/expats to showcase school experience and Bogotá life; To improve engagement,
the school will conduct focused “Listening Sessions” with staff to better understand the underlying factors behind lower-scoring items, especially concerns related to compensation fairness. Insights from these conversations, combined with the full EES dataset, will be incorporated into the 2026 SGS People & Culture Plan to ensure that actions reflect the real needs and expectations of employees. Additionally, the school will review compensation structures, recognition practices, and internal equity to address both actual and perceived misalignment, while enhancing communication around how compensation decisions are made. This holistic approach aims to strengthen trust, improve transparency, and elevate overall engagement.","Q1 & Q2; Q2&Q3; Q1, Q2 & Q3",In Progress; New,-0.00973236,0.064052288,0.066841415,0.06,0.2,-0.046666667,0.086666667,107.7022654,-0.011633125,0.824064712,0.823053589,3.76,0.0,0.3418,28.5,9.0,85.0,0.0,0.0,56.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,63.0,104.0,110.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

At present the stage in auditorium has basic lighting and audio capability which are not fit for purpose. The project is on the capex list but has been downgraded this year as we aim to make savings to meet the budget shortfall. Additional funding to bring this project forward will add to the visual investment profile of the school for parents. Estimated cost: $180,000USD; Canteen: As part of the bigger redevelopment of the campus we seek to enlarge the canteen space into what is currently the HR office, focusing on providing more seating areas for the students. Additional Capex would help to deliver this project earlier than planned. This project will compliment the new, soon to be shaded, patio dining and event space at the end of the campus. Estimated cost of upgrade and expansion $90,000USD; Sports Facilities redeveloping the current gymnasium into a modern, state of the art facility, will add to parent perception of improved facitlies for the 21st century. We could create spaces that meet the needs of a modern curriculum and additional items such as a weights gym and dance studio. This will help to match/improve on competitor facilities. Estimated cost $1.2 million USD; Value for money, enhanced KS3 Curriculum and English Language Support: To enhance the value for money and educational standards piece, a root and branch review of KS3 is currently underway with an exciting, besopke, curriculum being developed. This alongside planned growth in the English Language Support department will create a more desirable offer for famileis and allow GG to accept more FTEs in KS3 with EAL needs. Funding for resourcing will be key to success with this project. Estimated cost: TBC dependant on local or expat hires and resourcing of new curriculum; We applied for but did not hear about Capex to allow for concrete walkways around school to be resurfaced, funding for this would be another positive addition to the aesthetic of the school grounds.; The most recent PSS highlighted several areas for devleopment. Four of the key areas which have been highlighted and would add to parent perception of creating value for money and ensuring that our facilties compare to those of our competitors (ASF and Humanitree) are listed below. Anecdoetal evidence from a parent who swtched at the end of last year, ´GG facilities are third rate compared to modern schools.´ Additionall comments in the latest PSS mention outdated below expectations for facitlites and infrastructure.; Review and revise application and admissions policies and practices to streamline procedures and increase conversion rates from application to enrolment.; Maintain and extend average IB score from summer 2025 level.; Use EES data to refine retention strategies to minimise teacher attrition and associated recruitment costs. This will also displel misconception about unhappy teachers and poor salary and benefits that reached the parent community last year.",Address the gap between FTEs and Budget to increase fee income and flowthrough; Average IB score to be 34.6 or above; Have less than 10% teacher turnover for the academic year.,"With the Admissions Committee review policy and procedures; Targetted interventions, consistant and rigourous use of data drops, effective leadership oversight; Uplift rental allowances.

•Class Size: ≤25 students per class.
•Fees & Services: Tuition, school bus, uniform, and meals are aligned with the International Department.
•Support: Tailored ECA options and dedicated office space for teachers’ preparation and collaboration.; 1. Clear Positioning: Two Pathways to Excellence.The Domestic Division is not a substitute for the International Division, but an equally strong pathway designed to meet the needs of different families. Together, they form a diversified “education matrix” that strengthens the school’s brand and overall resilience.
2.Differentiated Strengths: Same Roots, Distinct Models
Domestic Division: Anchored in the national curriculum, with a strong focus on Chinese language, mathematical thinking, and scientific inquiry. Demonstrates strong performance in academic results and habit formation. Students may progress to Zhongkao/Gaokao pathways or transfer into international programmes.
International Division: Maintains the features of IB PYP and integrated curricula, emphasizing inquiry-based learning, interdisciplinarity, English proficiency, and a wide range of co-curricular opportunities.
3. Core Structure: Small-Class Format & Shared Resources
•Class size capped at 26 students; tuition set at approximately 68% of that of the international class.
•Schedule: 35 core lessons + 4 sessions for morning reading/homework support, aligned with the international division’s timetable.
•Shared resources include transportation, uniforms, meals, ECAs, and school-based specialty programmes (Sports, Arts, STEAM).
•Facilities: Classrooms L301 and L302.
4. Management Model: Independent Academic Division + Unified Functional Support
•A Director for the Domestic Curriculum Division will be appointed to oversee teaching and daily operations.
•Central administrative, HR, finance, marketing, and admissions teams will provide unified support to both divisions.
•Core academic teaching staff will be independently assigned, with opportunities for cross-division collaboration in later stages.; 1.Recruitment & Role Definition

The estimated cost for these new positions—including salary and benefits—is $960,000.; While this investment is significant, it directly addresses the concerns reflected in our Parent Satisfaction Survey, which shows a downward trend of 4 points on our Net Promoter Score (NPS). Reducing class sizes is one of the most direct and high-impact strategies we can implement to increase parent confidence, improve student outcomes, and enhance the overall teaching and learning experience.; Increase marketing efforts around Switch for Success​.

Launch The Benefits of Outdoor Play campaign ASAP to create FUD against top competitor.​

Secure speaking opportunities in key micro-communities​.

Create more demand for mid-year starters by proactively calling our relocation agents and pitching The Village School.; Develop more opportunities internally to discuss the value for money in a positive way directly to the parent community through: ​

1. Parent testimonials​
2. Alumni stories​
3. College scholarship features ​

​Do this through​

1. ParentSquare posts​
2. Website​
3. Blogs​
4. Podcast 

Partner with business office to call all 41 leavers to see how the new school is and if we can do anything to bring them back.; Parents are increasingly choosing our competitors because they offer smaller class sizes, enabling teachers to provide more individualized instruction and meaningful feedback. By lowering our secondary school class size to 18, we would be able to strengthen teacher–student relationships, increase engagement, and give teachers the time they need to plan effectively and deliver higher-quality, personalized feedback to every student.; Determine % of financial aid at competitor schools and how we compare.​

Offer more financial aid to families who are self pay. ​

Heavily promote facility improvements internally and externally.​

Be more deliberate with communications about college counseling, scholarships, matriculation, social/emotional learning; diverse student body, and school safety.​",22/05/2026; 09/08/2026; 07/09/2026,New,-0.040039063,0.076670318,0.081408141,-0.017374517,0.085637222,-0.033142907,-0.013761764,90.3100159,0.014657377,0.898866213,0.891609977,4.39,0.0,0.1037,4.17,166.0,184.0,7.0,31.0,318.0,7.0,119.0,204.0,4.0,90.0,268.0,783.0,593.0,22.0,14.0,17.0,6.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,23.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,8.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
